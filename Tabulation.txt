                                                 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TABULATION AND MEMOIZATION
                                                                 By Ansh Srivastava
Ex:
 arr[] 10 22 9 33 21 50 41 60 80
 LIS   1  2    3     4     5  6

Will go with overlapping, coz optimal is too lengthy to grasp:

Overlapping is very 1st technique in DP, continue.....
Overlapping consists of two techniques:1-memoization  2-Tabulation
Memoization is ur Top down approach while Tabulation is bottom up!

---->factorial of a NO:

dp[0]=1
dp[1]=dp[0]*1=1			<-Bottom up!(TABULATION)
dp[2]=dp[1]*2=2
dp[3]=dp[2]*3=6
dp[4]=dp[3]*4=24
dp[5]=dp[4]*5=120 and done!

Let’s describe a state for our DP problem to be dp[x] with dp[0] as 
base state and dp[n] as our destination state. So,  we need to find 
the value of destination state i.e dp[n].


Now we're goin' to hop over Memoization(Don't u remember i used it in Fibona
cci series)--->


dp[100]=-1
dp[1] = 1
solve(5)
dp[5] = 5 * solve(4)
dp[4] = 4 * solve(3)
dp[3] = 3 * solve(2)
dp[2] = 2 * solve(1)
dp[1] = 1 * solve(0)
	1 * 1 

If we need to find the value for some state say dp[n] and instead of starting 
from the base state that i.e dp[0] we ask our answer from the states that can 
reach the destination state dp[n] following the state transition relation, 
then it is the top-down fashion of DP.
